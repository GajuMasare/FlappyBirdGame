Sure, let's consider an example with some arbitrary values to demonstrate the logic:

Suppose we have the following constants and variables:

scss
Copy code
BACKGROUND_SCROLL_SPEED = 100   -- Background scrolling speed in pixels per second
BACKGROUND_LOOPING_POINT = 800 -- The width of the background before it starts looping

backgroundScroll = 0            -- Initial position of the background (in pixels)
Now, let's simulate the logic for a few frames:

Frame 1:
dt = 0.016 (assuming a frame rate of 60 frames per second)

The new position of the background is calculated as:
backgroundScroll = (backgroundScroll + BACKGROUND_SCROLL_SPEED * dt) % BACKGROUND_LOOPING_POINT
backgroundScroll = (0 + 100 * 0.016) % 800
backgroundScroll = 1.6 % 800 (since backgroundScroll is a floating-point number)

Therefore, backgroundScroll becomes 1.6.

Frame 2:
dt = 0.016 (again, assuming a frame rate of 60 frames per second)

The new position of the background is calculated as:
backgroundScroll = (1.6 + 100 * 0.016) % 800
backgroundScroll = (1.6 + 1.6) % 800
backgroundScroll = 3.2 % 800

Therefore, backgroundScroll becomes 3.2.

Frame 3:
dt = 0.016 (still assuming a frame rate of 60 frames per second)

The new position of the background is calculated as:
backgroundScroll = (3.2 + 100 * 0.016) % 800
backgroundScroll = (3.2 + 1.6) % 800
backgroundScroll = 4.8 % 800

Therefore, backgroundScroll becomes 4.8.

Frame 4:
dt = 0.016 (frame rate of 60 frames per second)

The new position of the background is calculated as:
backgroundScroll = (4.8 + 100 * 0.016) % 800
backgroundScroll = (4.8 + 1.6) % 800
backgroundScroll = 6.4 % 800

Therefore, backgroundScroll becomes 6.4.

As the simulation continues, the backgroundScroll value will keep increasing and eventually loop back to 0 when it exceeds BACKGROUND_LOOPING_POINT (800 in this example). The scrolling effect will give the illusion of a background moving at a constant speed while seamlessly looping back to the beginning, creating an infinite scrolling effect.
